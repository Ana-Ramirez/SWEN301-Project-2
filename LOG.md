# LOG


### MONDAY 30 APRIL
3 - 5pm: Started looking for project


### TUESDAY 1 MAY
4:45 - 7pm: Looking for project


### WEDNESDAY 2 MAY 
12:10 - 2:30pm: Looking for project. After doing my own research and talking to other students I've narrowed it down to a few projects. All of which seem either too simple or too hard


### THURSDAY 3 MAY
10:30 - 12:00pm: Reading source code of my options. Feeling very uncertain about how to even improve on a project, a friend and I went to talk to Stephen about options and tactics on how to improve architecture  
5 - 7pm: Continued reading source code of my options


### FRIDAY 4 MAY 
4 - 5:15pm: Decided to give up looking over code and to just pick one. I picked wikivoyage-listings (https://github.com/baturin/wikivoyage-listings) because I think I can improve it by creating a interactive GUI.


### SATURDAY 5 MAY 
12 - 5:10pm: Reading over code trying to understand it properly, then moved onto other assignments


### SUNDAY 6 MAY 
1 - 5pm: More time spent trying to understand and import code into Eclipse and IntelliJ. Had a breakdown, realised that my project is too complicated and I've wasted all weekend. Took a break to do ENGR301  
10:30pm: Picked BetaGo as my project (https://github.com/thomas1242/BetaGo). Seems like I'll be able to design the MVC to better the architecture. This week's gonna be fun...


### MONDAY 7 MAY 
3 - 5:15pm: Read a few of the achitecture essays recommended to us on http://aosabook.org.  
10 - 3am: Worked on essay. Have a decent copy of the history written, will need editing later but is good enough for now.


### TUESDAY 8 MAY
2 - 6pm: Worked on domain part of the essay  
9pm - 2am: Tried to get a UML diagram generator working on Eclipse. Ended up not working at all (no idea why, tried at least 2 different plugins), eventually ended up importing all the code into IntelliJ, generating the diagrams here, then going back to Eclipse. Finished working on domain part of the essay. Started Architecture part of the essay. Forgot to push (hence this being pushed late)


### WEDNESDAY 9 MAY
2:15 - 5pm: Architecture part of essay and lots of research about architecture and reading code. Had to stop for CYBR171 test  
11pm - 2:20am: Finished architecture part of essay. Pushing now (eventually).


### THURSDAY 10 MAY
3:30 - 7pm: Working on and finishing data structures part of essay


### FRIDAY 11 MAY
2 - 9pm: Working on redesigning/re-architectur-ing the code.
After 9pm: Something in my personal life came up - decided to take the 5% late pentalty


### SATURDAY 12 MAY
5 - 11:50pm: Prior to 5pm I was with my team doing ENGR301. Finished code architecture 10 minutes before another 5% pentalty would be applied, leaving me 10 minutes to write a 4 page report. Awesome. Taking another 5% penalty unfortunately...


### SUNDAY 13 MAY
6pm - 11pm: Writing architecture evaluation report and adding finishing touches
