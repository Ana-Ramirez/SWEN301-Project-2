# LOG


### MONDAY 30 APRIL
3 - 5pm: Started looking for project


### TUESDAY 1 MAY
4:45 - 7pm: Looking for project


### WEDNESDAY 2 MAY 
12:10 - 2:30pm: Looking for project. After doing my own research and talking to other students I've narrowed it down to a few projects. All of which seem either too simple or too hard


### THURSDAY 3 MAY
10:30 - 12:00pm: Reading source code of my options. Feeling very uncertain about how to even improve on a project, a friend and I went to talk to Stephen about options and tactics on how to improve architecture  
5 - 7pm: Continued reading source code of my options


### FRIDAY 4 MAY 
4 - 5:15pm: Decided to give up looking over code and to just pick one. I picked wikivoyage-listings (https://github.com/baturin/wikivoyage-listings) because I think I can improve it by creating a interactive GUI.


### SATURDAY 5 MAY 
12 - 5:10pm: Reading over code trying to understand it properly, then moved onto other assignments


### SUNDAY 6 MAY 
1 - 5pm: More time spent trying to understand and import code into Eclipse and IntelliJ. Had a breakdown, realised that my project is too complicated and I've wasted all weekend. Took a break to do ENGR301  
10:30pm: Picked BetaGo as my project (https://github.com/thomas1242/BetaGo). Seems like I'll be able to design the MVC to better the architecture. This week's gonna be fun...


### MONDAY 7 MAY 
3 - 5:15pm: Read a few of the achitecture essays recommended to us on http://aosabook.org.  
10 - 3am: Worked on essay. Have a decent copy of the history written, will need editing later but is good enough for now.
