## How to run it
1. Clone the whole repo
2. Open project Eclipse (need Eclipse Oxygen and JUnit 5)
3. Shouldn't need any extra imports, project should run fine on its own.


As stated above, to run the program in Eclipse, you need at least Eclipse Oxygen and JUnit 5, and the game is played in a GUI.  

The command to run the program's jar file via the command line is:  
java -jar SWEN301-Project-1.jar  


There is also a bash script provided (bashScript.sh).



### Note
Once I submitted, I realised that I hadn't handed my essays in as PDF files. I emailed James Noble and this was our email transaction to ensure that I do not get another 10% penalty for handing in 'late':  

'Hi James,

I submitted by 301 project just before midnight on the 13th May on both gitlab and the ecs submission system, however I forgot to export both of my reports to pdfs before I submitted them and they are currently docx files. Because of this, depending on what application they are opened in, they may be over the page limit of each report.
Is there a chance that I can resubmit these files as pdfs without facing another late penalty, or do you think it would be ok to leave them as docx files?

Thank you,

- Ana Ramirez'  


'Hi Ana
Please resubmit as PDF files - put a copy of this email to the end of your README file. 
James.'
